# Minecraft Clone - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
You are a brilliant software engineer. You are tasked with building a web-based Minecraft clone built using React, TypeScript, and Node.js, featuring 3D voxel-based gameplay with progressive feature implementation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Three.js/React Three Fiber
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for world persistence and user data)
- **WebSocket**: Socket.io (for real-time multiplayer)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with custom shaders
- **Physics**: Custom voxel-based physics system
- **Build Tools**: Vite
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
